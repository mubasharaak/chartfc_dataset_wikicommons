The spreadsheet automatically assembles XML code in the blue column, which the user copies and pastes into the .svg file.\nTo make similar charts, follow these instructions:\nDownload the spreadsheet from this Dropbox link and open the file using Microsoft Excel or other spreadsheet program.\nEnter data into the yellow-colored cells.\nIf needed, revise horizontal and vertical scaling factors (to convert your raw data into pixels that fit nicely into your chart area). The spreadsheet automatically calculates the other cells—including the text in the blue column which is the final SVG code.\nCOPY the blue column and PASTE into a text file, yourfilename.svg (must end in .svg)\nDisplay your SVG file in a browser or other program, to see if adjustments are needed.\nMake adjustments (scaling factor(s), colors, locations of labels, etc). Preferably, make the adjustments in the spreadsheet so they carry forward to the .svg file; of course, you can change the .svg file directly also but the changes won't migrate \"backward\" to the spreadsheet.\nFor detailed discussion of using spreadsheets to generate SVG code for other types of charts, click here.\nVisit my talk page with any suggestions or questions.\nIf this particular chart needs updating in future years, let me know and if possible I will update it myself.",

In the case of steam plants, it might pay tohave a common station, not for the sake of the diversityfactor, but for the sake of having a larger and conse-quently more economical plant. In Switzerland, how-ever, the size of a plant was limited strictly by thewater supply, and the interconnection of plants for eventhe same service was simply an operative precaution orconvenience. The same conditions might apply tosome hydroelectric developments in the United States.

This pattern is typical of many rocks examined with the rover's laser-firing Chemistry and Camera (ChemCam) instrument.\nIn the first two years since Curiosity landed in Mars' Gale Crater in August 2012, researchers have used ChemCam's laser and spectrometers to examine more than 600 rock or soil targets. The process, called laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, hits a target with pulses from a laser to generate sparks, whose spectra provide information about which chemical elements are in the target. Multiple laser shots are fired in sequence, each blasting away a thin layer of material so that the following shot examines a slightly deeper layer. \nThe photograph at left is from ChemCam's Remote Micro-Imager camera, taken during the 687th Martian day, or sol, of Curiosity's work on Mars (July 12, 2014). It shows a portion of the surface of Nova about 1.6 inches (4 centimeters) wide, centered at the spot where laser shots hit the baseball-size rock that same sol. \nThe graph at right show the brightness of the resulting spark at a range of wavelengths detected from each of the first 10 laser shots out of 100 total shots fired at the same point on the rock. The initial shots generated less brightness at a wavelength that is diagnostic for aluminum content, compared to shots after the dust coating on the rock had been cleared away by those first few shots.\nChemCam's laser zapping of this rock was the first ever during which Curiosity's arm-mounted Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) camera took images that caught the spark generated by a laser hitting a rock on Mars (see PIA18401).\n\nChemCam is one of 10 instruments in Curiosity's science payload. The U.S. Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory, in Los Alamos, New Mexico, developed ChemCam in partnership with scientists and engineers funded by the French national space agency (CNES), the University of Toulouse and the French national research agency (CNRS).

This graphic presents results from APXS, with the comparisons simplified across diverse elements by dividing the amount of each element measured in the rocks by the amount of the same element in a local soil, called \"Portage.\"\nVein-rich rocks contain elevated abundances of sulfur and calcium. Other rock targets are remarkably uniform in composition and similar to the Portage soil, excepting high chlorine. Brushing by Curiosity's Dust Removal Tool reveals lower abundances of sulfur in the rock than in the dust coating that the brushing removed.\nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., manages the Mars Science Laboratory Project and the mission's Curiosity rover for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The rover was designed and assembled at JPL, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.\n\nMore information about Curiosity is online at http://www.nasa.gov/msl and http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/.",

It is only proper to use the red-gold-red flag of Spain as its representation.\nPlease take into account that I have renounced to use the most proper flag, the Republican Flag. Although the majority of the victims were republicans, I assume that most of the international wikipedia users cannot recognize immediately Spanish Republican flag\nThey fought under the Republican flag and the Republican flag is still used in commemorations in all concentration camps, including of course Mauthausen. That is the adequate flag, whether users recognise it or not. \nIt is not, based on the following:\n\n1. The red/yellow/red Spanish flag is far from exclusive of the francoist regime, it was established a century and a half ago. 2. At the time of the Holocaust, as has been noted, it wasn't Spain's nor any other country's flag. 3. Applying the same criterium, the nazi flag shouldn't represent German nor Austrian prisoners.",

I created the table from this data.  I have calculated the Q1 and Q2 2007 data as follows:\n\nQ4 08: 735,000 = Q4 RealtyTrac release said foreclosure activity down \"nearly\" 4% from prior quarter. This is rounded.\nQ3 08: 765,558 = Cited on CNN [1]\nQ1 08: 649,917 = Directly cited in their Q1 press release.\nQ4:  527,740 = Stated in year-end press release [2]\nQ3:  446,726 = Stated in Q3 press release [3]\nQ2:  333,627 = Q3 number was stated as a 33.9% increase on Q2 number in table of press release.\nQ1:  239,770 = Half year report cited 573,397 properties; less Q2 number above.\nNote that Q1-Q4 2007 adds to 1,547,863, not the 1,285,873 RealtyTrac cited for full year. \nThe following is an explanation from RealtyTrac:  \"The reason for the numbers not adding up is that we run the reports for the year-end separately; we don’t just add up all the quarters. Because of the way the report is designed, it only counts each property once during the entire year even if the property has multiple filings against it during the timeframe used for the report. So when we run it for the entire year, the number will be lower than adding up all the quarters because there will be some properties that appeared in multiple quarters because they had foreclosure activity against them in more than one quarter.\"\n\nRealtyTrac includes default notices, auction sale notices and bank repossessions in its reporting and can include multiple filings on the same property. The number of total notices was 2.2 million for 2007, as cited in the year-end press release.",

        "caption": "06.25.2014\nMartian Rock and Dust Filling Studied with Laser and Camera\nhttp://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=6428\nScientists used the Chemistry and Camera (ChemCam) instrument on NASA's Curiosity Mars rover in June 2014 to examine a Martian rock \"shell\" about one inch (two to three centimeters) across, embedded in fine-grained bedrock and with a dust-filled hollow interior. This graphic combines an image of the target, called \"Winnipesaukee,\" with spectrographic results from using ChemCam's laser on a row of points including the rock, the matrix around it and the material filling it. \nThe image merges a high-resolution, black-and-white image from ChemCam's remote micro-imager and a color image form the telephoto-lens camera of Curiosity's Mast Camera (Mastcam). The ChemCam laser and camera atop of Curiosity's remote sensing mast were about 9 feet, 10 inches (3 meter) from Winnipesaukee when the instrument examined Winnipesaukee on the 654th Martian day, or sol, of the rover's work on Mars (June 8, 2014). Similar-appearing features have been seen previously in the mission, but this time ChemCam was able to provide chemical analysis of the structure. The instrument fired 30 laser shots at each of 10 locations indicated by black, red and green circles on the image. Three distinct types of materials were analyzed: the bedrock on each side of the structure, the \"shell\" material itself and the dust inside the void space. The colors of the lines on the graph below the image correspond to the colors of the circles marking the laser-shot locations. \nAnalysis of spectra from the bedrock (black circles) identified high abundances of oxides of silicon, aluminum and sodium, typical of a feldspathic composition. The material forming the \"shell\" (red circles) has a more basaltic or mafic composition, with higher iron and magnesium content. The dust (green circles) is almost certainly airborne material that accumulated in the void space. This dust contains a relatively high hydrogen (water) signature compared to other Martian materials, which is generally characteristic of the ubiquitous dust that forms a thin mantle on much of the surface.\nScientists are considering multiple hypotheses for how this hollow feature formed. Formation as a bubble or carapace of rock that was embedded in the surrounding sediment cannot be ruled out. One alternative considered more likely is that transport of fluids through the bedrock could produce pipe-like structures with a wall consisting of bedrock that either has reacted with the fluids or has been coated with other material. Another is that the feature formed due to cracks penetrating the bedrock, then a mineral cement filling the cracks, then wind erosion removing material from the center. \n\nChemCam is one of 10 instruments in Curiosity's science payload. The U.S. Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, N.M., developed ChemCam in partnership with scientists and engineers funded by the French national space agency, CNES, the University of Toulouse and research agency, CNRS. More information about ChemCam is available at http://www.msl-chemcam.com . The rover's MastCam was built by and is operated by Malin Space Science Systems, San Diego.",

Clinical Therapeutics. 2002 Jun;24(6):862-86; discussion 837.\nAbstract Conclusion:  The efficacy data indicate that both donepezil and rivastigmine can delay cognitive impairment and deterioration in global health for at least 6 months in patients with mild to moderate AD. Patients receiving active treatment will have more favorable ADAS-cog scores for at least 6 months, after which their scores will begin to converge with those of patients receiving placebo. Differences in methodology, types of direct or indirect costs included, and sources of cost data made it difficult to compare and synthesize findings of the economic studies; therefore, the cost-effectiveness data are inconclusive.\n(2)Takeka A, Loveman E, Clegg A, Kirby J et al.

Significant heterogeneity of ARC estimates existed across the studies and cannot be explained by the study or population characteristics investigated. Effect size of ARC was related to the initial MMSE score of the study population and the number of assessments.",

The instrument measured intensity of light at 6,144 wavelengths of ultraviolet, visible and infrared light emitted when it fired its laser at a rock target called \"Ithaca.\" This spectrum averages data from multiple laser firings at the same point on the rock, the lowest point in a series of targeted points on the same rock examined on Oct. 30, 2013. The firings at this particular point included the 100,000th laser shot by Curiosity on Mars. \n\nThe spectrum is typical of Martian volcanic (basalt) material. Although Ithaca is a sedimentary rock, the particles in the sediments that became the rock originated in igneous source rocks. The elements identified from the spectrum include a standard major-element suite of silicon, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, sodium, potassium, oxygen and titanium. Chromium and manganese, though not labelled, were also present.",

NASA reference missions reckon with durations of 180 days for the trip to Mars, a 500-day stay on Mars, and another 180-day trip back to Earth. RAD measurements inside shielding provided by the spacecraft show that such a mission would result in a radiation exposure of about 1 sievert, with roughly equal contributions from the three stages of the expedition. A Sievert is a measurement unit of radiation exposure to biological tissue. This graphic shows the estimated amounts for humans on a Mars mission and amounts for some other activities.\nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., manages the Mars Science Laboratory Project and the mission's Curiosity rover for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington.

The results analyzing the high temperature water release are consistent with smectite clay minerals.\nCuriosity's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument suite conducted the analysis. The first step in the analysis of a portion of this drilled sample was to heat the sample in a quartz oven to 1,535 degrees Farenheit (835 degrees Celsius) and analyze the gases as they were released using SAM's quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS). The signatures of more than five hundred mass values were sampled during the heating of this drilled sample and analyzed by the QMS. Five are shown in the graph. These traces are diagnostic of water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and two forms of sulfur (sulfur dioxide, the oxidized form, and hydrogen sulfide, the reduced form) measured by the QMS.\nThe second step in the analysis was to send a portion of the gas released from the sample to the tunable laser spectrometer (TLS) to measure isotopes of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen, in both water and carbon dioxide. The ratio of deuterium (a heavy form of hydrogen) to the lighter, more abundant form of hydrogen was lower than the deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio measured by SAM in more loosely bound water in the sample from the \"Rocknest\" drift. The high deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio in water in the Mars atmosphere is a signature of the lighter hydrogen more rapidly escaping to space over geological time. Therefore, measuring the deuterium-to-hydrogen in water released from rocks is one tool that can be used to explore ancient reservoirs of water on Mars.\nThe third step in the analysis was to inject gas trapped during the heating process into SAM's third instrument, the gas chromatograph. Individual compounds separate out in time in a long capillary column in this instrument and are then introduced into the QMS. The gas chromatograph mass spectrometer is a prime tool in the SAM search for organic compounds.\nThe ratio of reduced species to oxidized species released by the SAM ovens is significantly higher in this drilled bedrock than in the previously scooped dust samples. These results indicate a significant amount of available chemical energy because oxidized and less oxidized versions of molecules are present. This result, combined with suitable aqueous conditions at this site in the distant past, made this a potentially habitable environment.\nThe SAM analysis was conducted on Sol 200 (the 200th Martian day of Curosity's operations, which was Feb. 27, 2013, on Earth).\nJPL manages the Mars Science Laboratory/Curiosity for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The rover was designed, developed and assembled at JPL, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.\nFor more about NASA's Curiosity mission, visit: http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/msl, http://www.nasa.gov/mars, and http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl.\nImage Credit:\nNASA/JPL-Caltech/GSFC\nImage Addition Date:\n\n2013-03-12",

The spreadsheets produce lean SVG code, avoiding the \"extra stuff\" that Inkscape inserts. They should save you time in creating SVG charts.\nFeedback and suggestions on my talk page are welcome.

        "caption": "Bar chart of global surface temperature, with bars color-coded by El Niño and La Niña intensity.\nChart shows correlation of the (regional) El Niño–Southern Oscillation to global mean surface temperature. Suggested caption:\n\nColored bars show how El Niño years (red, regional warming) and La Niña years (blue, regional cooling) relate to overall global warming. El Niño years usually correspond to average global temperature increases, and La Niña years usually contribute to average global temperature decreases.\nEl Niño and La Niña intensity data is based on a year extending, roughly, from July of one year to June of the following year. Accordingly, I formed 12-month averages of global mean surface temperature anomalies from HadCRUT data extending from July to June, rather than the conventional calendar-year averaging.\nThe height of each bar is determined by temperature change for that time period, and the color of the bar is determined by the El Niño and La Niña intensity category in that time period.\nThe dark background, and black outlines of the individual bars, enable the colors to be seen more vividly.\n\nEl Niño and La Niña intensity data: https://ggweather.com/enso/oni.htm\n14 August 2021 archive thereof: https://web.archive.org/web/20210814091839/https://ggweather.com/enso/oni.htm\nSource explains: The Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) has become the de-facto standard that NOAA uses for identifying El Niño (warm) and La Niña (cool) events in the tropical Pacific.  It is the running 3-month mean SST anomaly for the Niño 3.4 region (i.e., 5oN-5oS, 120o-170oW).  Events are defined as 5 consecutive overlapping 3-month periods at or above the +0.5o anomaly for warm (El Niño) events and at or below the -0.5 anomaly for cold (La Niña) events.  The threshold is further broken down into Weak (with a 0.5 to 0.9 SST anomaly), Moderate (1.0 to 1.4), Strong (1.5 to 1.9) and Very Strong (≥ 2.0) events.  For the purpose of this report for an event to be categorized as weak, moderate, strong or very strong it must have equaled or exceeded the threshold for at least 3 consecutive overlapping 3-month periods.\nSource for temperature data: https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut4/data/current/time_series/HadCRUT.4.6.0.0.monthly_ns_avg.txt\n21 March 2021 archive thereof: https://web.archive.org/web/20210321090452/https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut4/data/current/time_series/HadCRUT.4.6.0.0.monthly_ns_avg.txt\nMetOffice's description of data file format: https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut4/data/current/series_format.html\n13 March 2021 archive thereof: https://web.archive.org/web/20210313052050/https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut4/data/current/series_format.html\nMost of the XML text for this SVG file was automatically generated by an adaptation of the Warming stripes bar chart spreadsheet linked below:\n\n\n General concept above; examples below.\nWarming stripes (composite)Warming stripes bar chart\nBar chart (vertical)Pie chart\nLine chartsScatterplot\nI've uploaded .xlsx (Microsoft Excel) spreadsheets that automatically generate XML code for charts in SVG format.\nYou simply paste or enter your data into the spreadsheet, and specify image dimensions, number of grid lines, font sizes, etc. The spreadsheet instantly and automatically generates a column of XML code that you simply copy and paste into a text editor and save as an \".svg\" file.

This graphic shows the principal gases evolved from the fourth portion of powder delivered to SAM from the sample material collected when Curiosity first drilled into the \"John Klein\" target rock in the \"Yellowknife Bay\" area of Mars' Gale Crater.\nThe mass spectrometer signal is scaled separately for each gas so that the same graph can illustrate the patterns for various gases showing what temperatures caused the gas to be released. These evolved gases and the temperatures at which they evolved suggest the presence of hydrated minerals, carbonates, perchlorates, sulfates and sulfides, and clays in the rock-powder sample.\nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., manages the Mars Science Laboratory Project and the mission's Curiosity rover for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington.

This graphic presents results from APXS, with the comparisons simplified across diverse elements by dividing the amount of each element measured in the rocks by the amount of the same element in a local soil, called \"Portage.\"\nVein-rich rocks contain elevated abundances of sulfur and calcium. Other rock targets are remarkably uniform in composition and similar to the Portage soil, excepting high chlorine. Brushing by Curiosity's Dust Removal Tool reveals lower abundances of sulfur in the rock than in the dust coating that the brushing removed.\nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., manages the Mars Science Laboratory Project and the mission's Curiosity rover for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The rover was designed and assembled at JPL, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.\nMore information about Curiosity is online at http://www.nasa.gov/msl and http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/.\nImage Credit:\nNASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Guelph\nImage Addition Date:\n\n2013-03-18",

The data come from the second Cumberland sample analyzed by SAM. The released gases were detected by SAM's quadrupole mass spectrometer.\nThe graphic shows four gases (oxygen, hydrochloric acid, carbon dioxide, and nitric oxide) evolved.\nThe mass spectrometer signal for each gas is scaled separately so that the same graph can illustrate the temperatures that caused the gas to be released (for example, nitric oxide, NO, has been scaled up 25 times). These evolved gases and the temperatures at which they evolved suggest the presence of oxychlorine compounds, such as perchlorates, and of carbon- and nitrogen-bearing components in the rock-powder sample.\nThe Cumberland target rock is in the \"Yellowknife Bay\" area of Mars' Gale Crater.\nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., manages the Mars Science Laboratory Project and the mission's Curiosity rover for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The rover was designed and assembled at JPL, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.\n\nMore information about Curiosity is online at http://www.nasa.gov/msl and http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/.",

It is still vague/obscure/uncertain.\nFirst - thanks for fixing my typo! Doh! Secondly, since I used source data to generate the original image I don't want to change it otherwise it could be considered original research. Finally, I personally believe that there is a big difference between being Non-religious and an Atheist. An Atheist is somebody who believes that there is no God with the same conviction that a Theist or Deist believes that there is a God. Somebody who is non-religious may not adhere to any particular religion, but has not discounted the possibility that a God exists - they may also be agnostic. I would probably put myself in the non-religious camp but would probably not call myself an atheist. Bryces (talk) 01:07, 23 June 2008 (UTC)\nThat's a rather generalist definition of atheism, what you described is the branch called \"Strong atheism\"; the belief there are no god(s). Whereas \"Weak atheism\", probably the most common of the two, is the disbelief in any gods. You can look up the definitions here; en:Weak and strong atheism -ramz- (talk) 07:08, 2 July 2008 (UTC)\nChinese Universists are not described in wikipedia, nor in the Encyclopedia Brittanica.

These species were detected by the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GCMS) on Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars instrument (SAM).\nThe blue peak on the left shows the presence of chloromethane and the two red peaks on the right show the presence of dichloromethane. The powdered rock sample from John Klein was heated and some of the gas released was injected into the capillary column of the GCMS. The time at which different compounds exited the gas chromatograph column and entered the mass spectrometer, and the patterns produced in the mass spectrometer indicated molecular identity.\nThis chart also indicates \"blank runs,\" which were conducted on Mars prior to delivery of this drilled sample to SAM. The runs helped to insure that signals from the gases released from the John Klein sample were above background levels. Curiosity began drilling at John Klein in February 2013. The SAM analysis was conducted on Sol 200 (the 200th Martian day of Curosity's operations, which was Feb. 27, 2013, on Earth).\nBoth chloro- and dichloromethane were also detected earlier by SAM at the \"Rocknest\" drift. It is possible that these simple carbon-containing compounds were produced by the reaction between Martian carbon and chlorine released when this sample was heated in the SAM oven. However, analysis of an additional drilled sample is required to help scientists understand if instead any residual terrestrial carbon from the drill, or perhaps chlorine left over from the Rocknest sample, is responsible for the generation of some or all of these compounds. In any case, these detections demonstrate clearly that the SAM GCMS is performing as designed and ready to continue the search for organic compounds in Gale Crater.\nJPL manages the Mars Science Laboratory/Curiosity for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The rover was designed, developed and assembled at JPL, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.\nFor more about NASA's Curiosity mission, visit: http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/msl, http://www.nasa.gov/mars, and http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl.\nImage Credit:\nNASA/JPL-Caltech\nImage Addition Date:\n\n2013-03-12",

        "caption": "PIA17762: Russian Hydrogen-Checking Instrument on Curiosity Fires 2 Millionth Pulse \nhttp://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17762\nThe Russian-made instrument on NASA's Mars rover Curiosity for detecting water that is adsorbed into soil or bound into shallow underground minerals has fired its 2 millionth pulse of energetic neutrons into the ground. It reached this milestone in late January 2014, not quite 18 months after the rover's landing on Mars in early August 2012.\nEach pulse into the ground lasts about one microsecond. The instrument, Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN), measures the flow of neutrons with different energy levels returning from the ground, and their delay times, as an indication of the amount and depth of hydrogen in the ground beneath the rover. Any detected hydrogen would most likely be in the form of water.\nThis graph shows the cumulative total of pulses from DAN's pulsing neutron generator (PNG) rising to the 2 million level (vertical axis) as time progressed from the start of the mission. The top horizontal axis is labeled by Earth dates; the bottom one by the number of sols (Martian days) into the mission.\nEach pulse DAN fires includes approximately 10 million high-energy neutrons, so the total number of neutrons fired by the device on Mars is about 20,000,000,000,000. That is about one-fifth of DAN's supply of these \"bullets\" for use during Curiosity's investigations on Mars.\nDAN detects water down to about 2 feet (60 centimeters) deep. During the rover's investigations so far, data from DAN have enabled researchers to calculate that an upper portion of that zone averages about 1.5 percent water content, by weight, and a deeper portion averages about twice as much. The amount of water has varied slightly along the route.\nRussia's Space Research Institute developed DAN in close cooperation with the N.L. Dukhov All-Russia Research Institute of Automatics, Moscow, and the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Dubna.\n\nMore information about Curiosity is online at http://www.nasa.gov/msl and http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/.",
