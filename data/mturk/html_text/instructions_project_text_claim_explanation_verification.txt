`<br> Welcome to the Claim-Explanation-Verification-Task. <br><br> We will show you <b>seven charts and (if available) their captions</b>. For each chart, you will be asked to do the following: <b>Check if the claim and explanation is TRUE (or FALSE in some cases) given the chart.</b> If yes, potentially rewrite the claim and explanation to <b>fix errors</b> (typos, grammar, upper case, etc.). If no, <b>rewrite the claim and explanation</b> to be TRUE (or FALSE in some cases) using only information from the chart and its caption. Please avoid using any additional sources or own knowledge.         <br><br> We will show you some examples of how to solve this task on the next page. <br><br> Afterwards, we will ask you <b>three questions</b>. You can progress to the task by answering these questions correctly. The task also includes some <b>checks</b> and we will <b>manually check submissions</b> before accepting.         You can only submit and receive payment by passing them successfully.         <br><br> The data collected in this study consist of your inputs, the time you spent on the task and the buttons clicked.
