`<br> Welcome to the Claim-Explanation-Generation-Task. <br><br> We will show you <b>seven charts and (if available) their captions</b>. For each chart, you will be asked to do the following: <b>Write a claim that can be verified or refuted given the chart and its caption.</b> Write the claim using only information from the chart and its caption. Please avoid using any additional sources or own knowledge. <br><br> We will also ask you to write <b>a short text (1-3 sentences) explaining why</b> the claim can be verified or refuted using the chart and caption. <br><br> We will show you some examples of how to solve this task on the next page. <br><br> Afterwards, we will ask you <b>three questions</b>. You can progress to the task by answering these questions correctly. The task also includes some <b>checks</b> and we will <b>manually check submissions</b> before accepting. You can only submit and receive payment by passing them successfully. <br><br> The data collected in this study consist of your inputs, the time you spent on the task and the buttons clicked.
